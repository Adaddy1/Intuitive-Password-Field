Interactive Password Strength Check Form
This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates an interactive login form with a password strength check feature. The form includes a password input field, a password strength indicator, and a submit button. The unique aspect of this form is that if the entered password is considered weak, the submit button will dynamically move away from the cursor as it approaches, making it challenging to click.

Features:
Password Strength Check: The password strength is evaluated using a regular expression that checks for a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Dynamic Submit Button: If the password is weak, the submit button will constantly move away from the cursor as it approaches the button, making it elusive and challenging to click.

Usage:
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
Enter a password in the password input field.
The password strength will be displayed, and the submit button will react dynamically based on the password strength.
If the password is weak, the submit button will move away from the cursor as it approaches.
Feel free to customize the code to fit your specific requirements.
